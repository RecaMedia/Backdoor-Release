### Installation

To begin installation, goto the URL that points to the Backdoor directory. For example, http://localhost/bkdr/ or http://bkdr.mydomain.com/. The installation wizard should prepopulate some of the inputs for you. Make sure the folder name of the Backdoor application is correct as this may effect some functionality. The default folder name is `bkdr`, unless you change it.

### Requirements

Make sure you have the following PHP modules installed: __*Sqlite3, Mcrypt*__. The www-data user would need writing permission for this application to work properly. Also, __*.htacces*__ files will need to be allowed to redirect within the /bkdr directory and subdirectories. You can use the following sample for your vhost to allow .htaccess redirects:
```
<Directory /var/www/>
	Options Indexes FollowSymLinks
	AllowOverride None
	Require all granted
</Directory>
```
